Sonic Pi Tool (Python)
=============

`sonic-pi-tool.py` is a rewrite of the Rust [sonic-pi-tool](https://github.com/lpil/sonic-pi-tool) in Python.
It is a handy command line utility for playing with the Sonic Pi
server. It can be used instead of the Sonic Pi GUI for all your music making
needs :)

It's ideal for use with [sonicpi.vim](https://github.com/dermusikman/sonicpi.vim)


## Installation

Sonic Pi Tool doesn't currently have a proper installer.
However it is just a simple Python script with a couple of dependencies,
so it's not hard to install manually:

```sh
# Install dependencies:
pip install click oscpy psutil

# Download script:
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/emlyn/sonic-pi-tool/master/sonic-pi-tool.py

# Make it executable:
chmod +x sonic-pi-tool.py

# Copy it somewhere on the PATH:
sudo cp sonic-pi-tool.py /usr/local/bin/
```

`sonic-pi-tool.py` should be compatible with both Python 2.7+ and Python 3.6+,
but it hasn't been tested extensively, so if you have trouble running it please file an issue.


## Usage

### Options

Options common to most or all commands:

- `--host`: The host name or IP address to use when communicating with the Sonic Pi server.
- `--cmd-port`: The port number on which the Sonic Pi server listens for incoming commands.
If this is negative, try to find the port number in the Sonic Pi server-log file,
and fall back to the absolute value specified if it can't be found in the log file.
- `--osc-port`: The port number on which the Sonic Pi server listens for incoming OSC cues.
- `--preamble` / `--no-preamble`: Some versions of Sonic Pi, when started without the GUI,
fail to initialise the OSC server. This adds a bit of code at the start of any evaluated code
to initialise the OSC server if it has not already been initialised.
- `--verbose` / `--no-verbose`: Print out more information to help with debugging.
- `--help` (or `-h`): Display help information.

### Commands

The available commands are:

- [check](#check): Check if Sonic Pi is running.
- [start-server](#start-server): Start Sonic Pi server process.
- [logs](#logs): Follow logs from Sonic Pi server process.
- [eval](#eval): Evaluate Sonic Pi code from command line.
- [eval-file](#eval-file): Evaluate Sonic Pi code from a file.
- [eval-stdin](#eval-stdin): Evaluate Sonic Pi code from stdin.
- [run-file](#run-file): Run a file in Sonic Pi without sending contents.
- [osc](#osc): Send an OSC message to Sonic Pi (or other OSC server).
- [record](#record): Record Sonic Pi sound to a wav file.
- [stop](#stop): Stop any running Sonic Pi code.
- [shutdown](#shutdown): Shut down any running Sonic Pi processes.

#### `check`

Used to check if the Sonic Pi server is running. If the server isn't running
many of the tool's commands (such as `eval`) will not work.

This command returns an exit code of zero if the server is running,
one if it is not running, or two if it cannot determine whether it is running.

```sh
sonic-pi-tool.py check
# Sonic Pi is running, and listening on port 4557 for commands and 4560 for OSC
```


### `start-server`

Attempts start the Sonic Pi server, if the executable can be found.
Searches a few standard locations, first in the current directory,
then the users home directory
and finally some standard install locations.

If it is unable to find your installation, you can pass the location in the `--path` option.
Please also consider raising an issue including the path to your install,
and I will add it to the list of search paths.

Not currently supported on Windows.

```sh
sonic-pi-tool.py start-server
# Sonic Pi server booting...
# Using protocol: udp
# Detecting port numbers...
# ...
```


### `logs`

Prints out log messages emitted by the Sonic Pi server.

This command won't succeed if the Sonic Pi GUI is running as that will already
be consuming the logs itself.

```sh
sonic-pi-tool.py logs
#
# [Run 2, Time 32.7]
#  └ synth :beep, {note: 65.0, release: 0.1, amp: 0.9741}
#
# [Run 2, Time 32.8]
#  └ synth :beep, {note: 39.0, release: 0.1, amp: 0.9727}
```


### `eval`

Take a string of Sonic Pi code and send it to the Sonic Pi server to be
played.

```sh
sonic-pi-tool.py eval "use_real_time; play :C4"
# *ding*
```


### `eval-file`

Read Sonic Pi code from a file and send it to the Sonic Pi server to be
played. If the file is too big, consider using `run-file` instead.

```sh
sonic-pi-tool.py eval-file path/to/code.rb
# *music*
```


### `eval-stdin`

Read Sonic Pi code from standard in and send it to the Sonic Pi server to be
played.

```sh
echo "play :C4" | sonic-pi-tool.py eval-stdin
# *ding*
```


### `run-file`

Send a command to the Sonic Pi server to load and play the specified file.
This avoids problems with files being too long since the entire content no longer
needs to fit in a single OSC message.

```sh
sonic-pi-tool.py run-file path/to/code.rb
# *music*
```


### `osc`

Send an OSC cue to Sonic Pi.
Allows a running Sonic Pi script to receive data from or synchronise to an external system.

``` sh
sonic-pi-tool.py osc /trigger/foo 123
# Triggers `sync "/osc*/trigger/foo"` command running in Sonic Pi
```


### `record`

Record the audio output of a Sonic Pi session to a local file.
Stop and save the recording when the Enter key is pressed.

```sh
sonic-pi-tool.py record /tmp/output.wav
# Recording started, saving to /tmp/output.wav.
# Press Enter to stop the recording...
```


### `stop`

Stop all jobs running on the Sonic Pi server, stopping the music.

```sh
sonic-pi-tool.py stop
# *silence*
```


### `shutdown`

Shut down any Sonic Pi processes (started either with the GUI or the start-server command).
Can be used to shut down any stray processes left if Sonic Pi fails to shut down correctly,
as these can sometimes prevent Sonic Pi from starting up again.

``` sh
sonic-pi-tool.py shutdown
# Sonic Pi has been shut down
```
